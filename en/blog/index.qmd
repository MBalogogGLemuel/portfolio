# Blog

This blog is a space for **technical reflections on data science, optimization, and AI systems**.

I focus on **model design, decision-making, and operational realism**, often taking a
**skeptical stance toward current AI hype**, especially when AI is presented as a
replacement for structured reasoning in optimization and forecasting.
