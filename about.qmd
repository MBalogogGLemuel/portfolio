I am a **data science / optimization / data engineering** professional with a hands-on approach: starting from operational constraints, structuring data, modeling, measuring impact with KPIs, and delivering usable artifacts (code, dashboards, docs).

My current focus: **supply chain & optimization**, ERP integration (Dynamics 365 SCM), and time series forecasting (energy / demand).
